### Committing your work (9/10)

  * **-1** Even though you have correctly added a .gitignore to your repository, the .gitignore does not remove files that are already committed. To remove these files from your repo, you can use the `git rm [file]` command.

### Specification fulfillment (20/20)

### Validation (17/20)

  * **-3**  Your calculator crashes when the hidden input fields are removed. The application should not crash as a result of any client provided information. You shouldnâ€™t assume that clients will always send input in the format that you specify. HTTP requests can be very easily forged.

### Routing and configuration (10/10)

### Coverage of technologies (40/40)
